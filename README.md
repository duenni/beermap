# beermap

This project scrapes a DokuWiki page with help from [kimonolabs] (https://www.kimonolabs.com). The resulting data is displayed in a map marker. The map is generated with [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/). [EasyButton] (https://github.com/CliffCloud/Leaflet.EasyButton) and [FontAwesome] (http://fontawesome.io/) are used here, too.
